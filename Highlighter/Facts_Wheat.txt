Dry winters and springs make the protein, or gluten, content high, and the moisture content low.

Hard wheat is grown in cool, dry climates, either in the winter or the spring.

Wheat is the only grain with the proper amount of gluten to facilitate the rising of bread dough to make light, soft loaves.

Wheat is important not only for its nutritional value, but also for its gluten content.

﻿Wheat is the world’s most important grain crop.

Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).

White wheat, on the other hand, is very mild in flavor and a light golden color when baked, hence the name, Golden 86, for one white wheat variety.
