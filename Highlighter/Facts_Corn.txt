Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain.

The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.

The leafy stalk of the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or ears, which are fruits, yielding kernels or seeds.

Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice.

It's believed that beginning about 2500 BC, the crop spread through much of the Americas.

Maize, also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago.

Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.
