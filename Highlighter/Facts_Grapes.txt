A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis.

Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.

The portability, texture, flavor and variety of grapes have made them a popular finger food in countries all over the world.

Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil.

Seventy-two million tons of these berries are grown each year worldwide, with most of them being used to produce wine - 7.2 trillion gallons of wine per year, to be exact.

The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000–8,000 years ago in the Near East.

The ways to consume grapes are endless - from red, green and purple grapes to seedless grapes, grape jelly, grape jam and grape juice - don't forget wine and raisins!

This popular fruit's history goes back as far as 8,000 years, when grape vines were first cultivated in what is now the Middle East.
